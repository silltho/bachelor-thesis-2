@article{Albanese2004,
abstract = {The first step in a video indexing process is the segmentation of videos into meaningful parts called shots. In this paper we present a formal model of the video shot segmentation process. Starting from a mathematical characterization of the most common transition effects, a video segmentation algorithm capable to detect both abrupt and gradual transitions is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on the computation of an arbitrary similarity measure between consecutive frames of a video. The algorithm has been tested adopting a similarity metric based on the Animate Vision theory and results have been reported.},

@inproceedings{Bosch2014,
abstract = {Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a standard language for stylizing and formatting web documents. Its role in web user experience becomes increasingly important. However, CSS files tend to be designed from a result-driven point of view, without much attention devoted to the CSS file structure as long as it produces the desired results. Furthermore, the rendering intended in the browser is often checked and debugged with a document instance. Style sheets normally apply to a set of documents, therefore modifications added while focusing on a particular instance might affect other documents of the set. We present a first prototype of static CSS semantical analyzer and optimizer that is capable of automatically detecting and removing redundant property declarations and rules. We build on earlier work on tree logics to locate redundancies due to the semantics of selectors and properties. Existing purely syntactic CSS optimizers might be used in conjunction with our tool, for performing complementary (and orthogonal) size reduction, toward the common goal of providing smaller and cleaner CSS files.},

@article{Fried2008,
abstract = {Recently, a debate has begun over whether in-class laptops aid or hinder learning. While some research demonstrates that laptops can be an important learning tool, anecdotal evidence suggests more and more faculty are banning laptops from their classrooms because of perceptions that they distract students and detract from learning. The current research examines the nature of in-class laptop use in a large lecture course and how that use is related to student learning. Students completed weekly surveys of attendance, laptop use, and aspects of the classroom environment. Results showed that students who used laptops in class spent considerable time multitasking and that the laptop use posed a significant distraction to both users and fellow students. Most importantly, the level of laptop use was negatively related to several measures of student learning, including self-reported understanding of course material and overall course performance. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.},
